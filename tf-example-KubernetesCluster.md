To deploy a K3s Kubernetes cluster in AWS using Terraform, let's break down the components and steps in more detail.

## 1. **Prerequisites**

- **AWS Account:** Make sure you have an AWS account set up.
- **AWS CLI:** Install the AWS CLI and configure your credentials.
  - Instructions for installation: [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- **Terraform:** Install Terraform on your local machine.
  - Instructions for installation: [Terraform Installation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
  
Once you've set up the AWS CLI and Terraform, configure the AWS credentials using:
```bash
aws configure
```

This will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, default region, and output format.

## 2. **K3s Overview**

### What is K3s?
K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments. It's ideal for edge computing and small-scale clusters, making it a great choice for quickly deploying a Kubernetes cluster in AWS without the overhead of a full Kubernetes setup.

### Why K3s in AWS?
- **Lightweight:** Uses fewer resources compared to standard Kubernetes.
- **Simplicity:** Easier setup and management.
- **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with AWS services for scalability and integration.

## 3. **Infrastructure Setup with Terraform**

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a highly available K3s cluster on AWS using Terraform. We'll deploy all components within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure isolation.

### **Components Overview**
1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Isolated network environment for our cluster.
2. **Subnets:** Two subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure high availability.
3. **Internet Gateway:** Provides outbound access to the internet for the resources in the VPC.
4. **Route Tables:** To manage the traffic routing within the VPC.
5. **Security Groups:** To control inbound and outbound traffic to the nodes.
6. **EC2 Instances:** Running the K3s control plane and worker nodes.
7. **Load Balancer:** For distributing traffic to control plane nodes.
8. **IAM Roles:** For securely managing permissions for resources.
9. **Route 53:** For DNS management to access the cluster.
10. **Systems Manager (optional):** To access instances without using SSH.

### Terraform Configuration

#### 1. **Initialize a Terraform Project**

Create a new directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir k3s-aws-cluster
cd k3s-aws-cluster
```

Create a new file named `main.tf` for your Terraform configuration.

#### 2. **Define the AWS Provider**

Add the AWS provider block to your `main.tf`:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-central-1"
}
```

#### 3. **VPC and Subnet Configuration**

Set up the VPC and subnets for your K3s cluster:
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "k3s_vpc" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "subnet_a" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.k3s_vpc.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-central-1a"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "subnet_b" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.k3s_vpc.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-central-1b"
}
```

#### 4. **Internet Gateway and Route Tables**

Create an internet gateway and route tables for communication:
```hcl
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.k3s_vpc.id
  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-igw"
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table" "public_route_table" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.k3s_vpc.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.igw.id
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "subnet_a_association" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.subnet_a.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_route_table.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "subnet_b_association" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.subnet_b.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_route_table.id
}
```

#### 5. **Security Group Setup**

Define a security group to control access to your EC2 instances:
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "k3s_security_group" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.k3s_vpc.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 6443
    to_port     = 6443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-security-group"
  }
}
```

#### 6. **EC2 Instances for Control Plane and Worker Nodes**

Deploy EC2 instances that will run the K3s control plane and worker nodes:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "control_plane" {
  ami                    = "ami-0a91cd140a1fc148a"  # Replace with your preferred AMI
  instance_type          = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id              = aws_subnet.subnet_a.id
  security_groups        = [aws_security_group.k3s_security_group.name]
  key_name               = "your-key-pair"

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-control-plane"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "worker_node" {
  ami                    = "ami-0a91cd140a1fc148a"  # Replace with your preferred AMI
  instance_type          = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id              = aws_subnet.subnet_b.id
  security_groups        = [aws_security_group.k3s_security_group.name]
  key_name               = "your-key-pair"

  tags = {
    Name = "k3s-worker-node"
  }
}
```

#### 7. **Load Balancer Setup**

Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to handle traffic to the control plane nodes.

```hcl
resource "aws_lb" "k3s_lb" {
  name               = "k3s-nlb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "network"
  subnets            = [aws_subnet.subnet_a.id, aws_subnet.subnet_b.id]

  enable_deletion_protection = false
}
```

#### 8. **IAM Roles and Policies**

Create IAM roles and policies to allow your cluster nodes to access AWS resources.

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "k3s_node_role" {
  name = "k3s-node-role"

  assume_role_policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "k3s_node_policy" {
  name       = "k3s-node-policy"
  roles      = [aws_iam_role.k3s_node_role.name]
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore"
}
```

## 4. **Deploy the Cluster**

1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Plan the deployment:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Deploy the resources:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

This will create all the necessary AWS resources for your K3s cluster.

## Conclusion

This setup provides a solid foundation for deploying a highly available K3s Kubernetes cluster in AWS. The cluster uses multiple Availability Zones, a load balancer for traffic distribution, and IAM roles for secure AWS service access. You can further customize the cluster and scale it as needed based on your application requirements.
